# ESPwithSensors
Connect a Dallas-Temperature Sensor and a Color-Sensor to an ESP32 with a WLAN connection 

In this Program a combination of serveral RGB-Sensors TCS34725 and Temperature-Sensors DS18B20
are reading the actual temperature as well as the actual RBG-Values and send them in a HTTP-Post over WLAN to a
Server in form of JSON-Packages

The TCS34725 and DS18B20 librarys can also find here on GitHub if further documentation is needed
